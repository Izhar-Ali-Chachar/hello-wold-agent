You: hi
AI: Hi there! How can I help you today?
You: I am Izhar
AI: Hello Izhar! It's nice to meet you. What can I do for you today?
You: who am I
AI: As a large language model, I don't have personal knowledge of who you are. I can't see you, hear you, or access any personal information about you unless you explicitly provide it to me in our conversation.

**So, to answer your question directly: I don't know who you are.**

If you'd like to tell me something about yourself, I'm happy to listen! For example, you could tell me:

*   Your interests
*   What you're working on
*   Why you're here
*   Anything else you'd like to share!
